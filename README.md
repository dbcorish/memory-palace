Abstract:

Standard memorisation techniques are often dull, boring, and not conducive to how human memory functions. Memory techniques such as visualisation & storytelling are more exciting to the mind, aiding memorisation of information. We may pair these techniques with VR devices to further enhance learning and recall.

This project sets out to create a virtual Memory Palace application which allows the user to place objects throughout a virtual environment to recall information more naturally. The project builds on an earlier implementation created in the Unity engine, porting & expanding the application to the open-source Godot engine.

The application enables the user to explore a virtual house using a VR head-mounted display. The user has the capability to select and place objects via interaction with an intuitive menu interface, learning to associate each object with its space in the environment. The application has been built with extensibility in mind, allowing environments to be swapped out or the menu expanded with a new set of items.
